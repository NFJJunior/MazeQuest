# MazeQuest
Matrix game for IntroductionToRobotics course, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

## Backstory
Last year, a friend of mine took the IntrodoctionToRobotics course. For his final project, he made a maze with invisible bombs.
I enjoyed the game creation process and offered to design a map too. The final level of this game is a modified version of the map that I designed last year.

For my final project, I decided to enhanced my friend's game, adding new features.

## Description
The game is a maze with invisible bombs. Your goal is to move from top-left to botton-right without exploding any bomb.

The game is design to logically deduce the path you need to take without guessing.

There are 2 levels that contain additional objects. In these levels, you firstly need to find a key to open a door in order to progress till the end.
